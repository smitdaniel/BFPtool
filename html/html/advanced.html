%% Advance guidelines
% This file contains step-by-step instructions how to use specialised
% features of the BFPTool to resolve difficulities in tracking and
% introduces basic analysis and support tools incorporated. This text
% assumes the reader is familiar with the basics of the tool as illustrated
% in the 
% <./basic.html Basic guideline>
% .
%
% The first half of this guide treates features, which allow user to
% construct a chain of incontiguous intervals to track, allowing her to
% avoid frames unsuitable for tracking (e.g. poor or variable contrast)
% or frames, where tracking is not necesary (e.g. the probe is
% disconnected). In the second half, post-tracking processing is discussed.
%
%% Contrast analysis
% After opening a video, the contrast analysis should be performed
% (*Analyse contrast* button). During the analysis, 2D standard deviation
% of intensity is calculated for each frame of the video and normalized to
% have maximum of 1. This metric is called *SD2*. It is parsed, and
% intervals of frames with *SD2* below 95% are reported. This can help user
% to identify intervals, which would be difficult to track and exclude
% them. At the same time, running standard deviation of the *SD2* metric is
% calculated, to account for contrast local variability, called *rSD2*; it is also normalised to maximum of 1.
% Intervals of variable contrast are particularly difficult to track. User
% can switch between the two metrics using radio button *SD2* / *rSD2* in the
% *Tracking* panel. Two exemplary measures can be seen in |Figure 1A,B|
%
% <<advancedCont.png>>
% 
% |Figure 1A,B: A REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH- SD2 contrast metric, intervals of metric < 95% are
% labelled by blue line; B REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH- rSD2 metric, high peaks represent intervals
% of high variability, which should be reviewed|
%
% After revisions based on results from |figure 1|, we notice the video can
% be tracked in intervals *(1,1100)*, *(1600,2000)* and *(2500,3000)*. We
% can see that the focus is roughly the same in these intervals, therefore
% we can track all three of them using the same *pipette pattern*. To share
% a pattern across several intervals, we will use *Tracking list panel*.
%
%% Tracking list
% # Click *Show tracking list panel* on the *Import, export, UI settings*  
% panel. Two subpanes will be displayed, *Pipette patterns* and *Bead
% tracking*.
% # Click *Select* on the *Pipette patterns* pane, draw a box around the
% pipette tip and confirm (procedure is the same as in 
% <./basic.html Basic guideline> 
% ).
% # Anchor position prompt dialog is displayed. You can click *Default* and
% anchor is positioned in the centre of the pattern. If You click *Select*,
% the pointer turns into cross-hair over the mini-axes, where the pattern
% is displayedREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-position a marker on the pattern to designate the *anchor*
% and click *Accept* button (see |Figure 2|).
% # Click *Add* to add the pattern to the list of pipette patterns. Its
% coordinates and time frame are displayed in the drop-down menu (see |Figure 2|).
% # Click *Select* on the *Bead tracking* pane, select the bead for
% tracking the same way as in the 
% <./basic.html Basic guideline>
% .
% # Click *Add* to add it to the list of beads.
%
% <<advancedAnchor.png>>
%
% |Figure 2: Selecting *anchor* point in mini-axes of *Pipette patterns*
% pane, before it is added to the list.|
%
% With the pipette pattern and the bead data saved, the chain of intervals
% can be constructed.
%
%% Building intervals list
%
% # On the *Set interval* tab, on the *Selected bead* line, click *List*
% button (blue box in |Figure 3|). The bead currently selected in the drop-down list in *Bead
% tracking* pane as selected for tracking in the interval.
% # On the line *Selected pattern* click *List* button (red box in |Figure 3|). The pipette pattern
% is selected from the *Pipette patterns* pane list the same way.
% # Click the *Show* button to see the pipette pattern with the *anchor*
% point marked. 
% # If You wish to reposition the *anchor*, You can click
% *Select* button on the line *Pattern anchor*, reposition it in the new
% figure and click the *Accept* button.
% # In the first edit filed on the *Interval* line (green box in |Figure
% 3|), type the first frame of the interval, *1*. In the second field
% (yellow box in |Figure 3|), type the last frame of the first interval,
% *1100*.
% # In the last edit field on the line *Interval* (brown box in |figure 3|), type the _index_
% unstrained RBC reference frame. In our example, it is *81*.
% # Click *Add to list* button, to add this interval to the list of
% intervals. It is added without any modifications.
% # You can review the interval information in the *List of intervals* tab
% of the same pane. In the same tab, You can erase an interval by checking
% its *Remove* box in the last collumn, and clicking the *Erase* button.
%
% <<advancedInt.png>>
%
% |Figure 3: *Interval list* panel|
%
% *Adding compatible intervals*
% 
% # Go to the first frame of the second interval, *1600* in our example,
% and add the bead. You can either go through the *Bead tracking* pane, to
% have the bead saved, in case You need to rebuild the list, or, You can
% select it directly using *Select* button on the *Selected bead* line of
% *Set interval* pane (see 
% <./basic.html Basic guideline>
% ).
% # Click *List* to add the same pipette pattern as in the first interval.
% Note that using the same pattern with the same *anchor* makes results
% from the two intervals fully compatible and comparable.
% # Set the interval *(1600,2000)* in the line *Interval*, keep the
% *anchor* *81*.
% # Click *Add to list*. Program will display several dialog windows as it
% tries to locate the pipette pattern from another interval *(1,1100)* in the 
% initial frame *1600* of newly added interval. It will be delineated by a
% red box. If the positioning appear correct, accept the location.
% # Use the same procedure to add the last interval, *(2500,3000)*.
%
% The added intervals are compatible with the same pipette pattern. We can,
% however, add one more interval (after closely inspecting the video), with
% transiently stable contrast, *(1200,1400)*, which has a separate,
% incompatible, pipette pattern.
%
% *Adding incompatible interval*
%
% # Go to frame *1200* and use the same technique as in
% <./basic.html Basic guideline> 
% to set up an interval ending in frame *1400*.
% # If *reference distance frame* is not available in the interval, we can
% try to arbitrarily select the first frame of the interval, *1200*, and
% then, during analysis, try to shift the results, so they align with the values at the end of the
% previous interval (note this can be doce, only if pipette and the bead
% do not change position during the focus transition).
% # Add the interval to the list using *Add to list* button.
%
% In the tab *List of intervals*, we can see four added discontiguous
% intervals, as shown in |Figure 4|. Note the *Erase* button marked by the
% red boxREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-clicking it erases intervals marked by checked boxes in the
% last collumn (not in the field).

%
%% Probe calibration
% To obtain the calibrated, physical, results for *Force*, we need to
% calibrate the probeREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-measure its geometrical features.
%
% # Click *Show experimental data panel* on the *Import,export and UI
% settings* panel. The panel is displayed in the bottom right.
% # Type in *Pixel to micron* ratio. This should be available at Your
% experimental setup. If You miss this information, You can input an
% estimate, by measuring a scale bar or a calibrated object in Your video.
% Note that is You change the *Pixel to micron* ratio, You must *Update*
% the computational object and re-track Your video.
% # In *Pressure* field, type in the aspiration pressure.
% # Click *RBC radius* field. The pointer turns into a cross-hair. 
% # Click inside the unotuched RBC (i.e. it is not in contact with the bead) and
% click the button *Confirm*. The RBC is delineated; accept is detected
% properly, program updates the radius accordingly.
% # Click *Pipette radius* button. Draw a line accross the inner diameter
% of the pipette at the inner appex of the RBC and click *Confirm*. The
% pipette radius is updated.
% # Similarly, click the *Contact radius* button and measure the length of
% the contact between the RBC and the bead, then confirm.
% 
% All the parameters can be also typed directly in the appropriate edit
% fields, if measured externally. These values allow the tool to calculate
% the stiffness $k$ of the particular probe. Clicking the *Get Force*
% button on the *Tracking* panel calculates the $k$ and the *Force* for the
% defined intervals. In |Figure 5| can be seen the results, note the discontiguity
% and the second interval shifted beacause of the arbibtrary reference 
% distance selection. Also note the huge peak in the first interval, it
% corresponds to rupture of the probeREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-the bead and pipette were still
% tracked, but their mutual distance did not correspond to the RBC
% distance, such intervals should be excluded from tracking and analysis. 
% More details on the *Force* calculation and buttons *?* and *k* can be found in the
% <./basic.html Basic guideline>
% .

%
%% Plotting the results
% The results can be plotted using the plotting interface on the panel
% *Tracking*. The quantity to plot can be picked from the drop-down list
% just under the *Plot* button. The use of the interface is
% straightforward:
%
% # In the edit fields right of *Plot* button, input the first and the last
% frame of requested interval to plot (note the first number must be
% smaller than the second).
% # Check boxes *Pipette* if You want plot data for the pipette and/or
% *Bead* if You want to plot data for the bead. (Does not apply for *Force*
% and *Contrast*)
% # From the drop-down menu, select the quantity You want to plot, of the
% list *Force*, *Contrast*, *Metric* (i.e. detection strength metric),
% *Tracks (3D)* and *Trajectories (2D)*.
% # Click *Plot*, the quantity is plotted in the *Graph* area in the upper
% right.
%
%% Basic Fitting tool
% The panel *Basic Fitting* contains basic tools to fit a *Line*,
% *Exponentiel* and detect *plateaux*.
%
% # Select interval to fit. Click *Choose interval* button and drag two
% blue dots accross the graph to delimit the interval (see |Figure 6|).
% # Click *Accept [X,X]*. The button will change to *Change [X,X]*,
% allowing further changes of the interval. Buttons on the *Basic Fitting*
% panel become enabled.
% # Click *Fit line* or *Fit exponentiel* to fit the graph with
% particular lines/curve (see |Figure 7A|).
% # Click *Fit plateau* to detect plateaux in the graph (see |Figure 7B|).
% # Click buttons *Sensitivity*, *Thresh* and *Length* to input settings
% for plateaux detection, respectively:
%
% * sensitivity to edges, higher number means higher tolerane to steps
% * level of signal variance in the interval still considered a plateaux
% * minimal length of a pleateau

%% Import, export and UI settings
% There is a set of sources and targets for imports and exports. Not all
% combinations are supported. You can choose the two locations from the two
% drop-down menues and use the buttons *Export* and *Import* to transfer
% data in the given direction. The individual locations are:
%
% *Internal data sources/targets*
%
% * force & tracks: data of tracked trajectories and calculated force in
% form of columns of values
% * frame: the currently displayed fram in *video player*
% * graph: the current content of the *graph* area with the axes
% * parameters: the whole current session exported into MAT file; can be
% openned later or on another machine
%
% *External data sources/targets*
%
% * workspace: data in the Matlab *base* workspace
% * data file: external data file, like DAT, CSV, MAT etc.
% * figure/media: media files, images, Matlab figure files
%
% The same panel contains settings for the tool's GUI.
%
% * Verbose: when checked, more dialog windows are displayed, if unchecked,
% the warnings are redirected to the command window
% * UI Fontsize: size of GUI font. Numbers above 1 are values in pixels,
% number in the interval (0,1] are normalized font sizes. These may help to
% tune the GUI to various screen sizes. Initially, all GUI items are
% autoscaled to their _uicontrol_ objects.
% * Show/hide toggles: allow to hide some of the panel, which are not always
% necessary.
%
%% Detection settings
% Click *Show advanced detection panel* on *Import,export,UI settings*
% panel to display the panel. It contains settings and thresholds used by
% the tracking methods, _TrackBead_ and _TrackPipette_.
%
% *Pipette*
%
% * Correlation thresh: level of correlation coefficient to initiate
% corrective procedures trying to improve the detection. These are search in
% less restricted area or attempts to dilate or erode the pattern. Note these
% proedures cost considerable computational time and benefits are limited.
% * Contrast thresh: threshold to initiate routine checks if contrast drops.
% * Buffer frames: number of allowed consecutive detection failures before the
% tracking method aborts.
%
% *Bead*
% 
% * Range radius: search for beads with radii within this radius. The
% radius range can be calibrated by clicking the *Radius range* button,
% clicking a bead in the frame and confirming. The bead is detected, if
% user accepts, the radius range is modified based on the radius $R$ of the
% detected bead (i.e. $(0.5R, 1.5R)$).
% * Buffer frames: number of allowed consecutive detection failures before the
% tracking method aborts.
% * Sensitivity: sensitivity to possible circular objects.
% 1-sensitivity=threshold of Hough circular transform accumulation array.
% Higher sensitivity means detection of weaker and partial circles.
% * Gradient: gradient threshold to detect edge pixels eligible to vote in
% the accumulator array. The lower the threshold the higher the
% sensitivity.
% * Metric thresh: threshold on the detection metric before other
% thresholds are relaxed and search is retried.
%
% This concludes the full explanatou of the BFPTool GUI.
