Once the file has been selected, it can be opened by clicking <b>Open</b>. The video will load and the first frame will be displayed in the video player. Data will be populated in the <b>Video information</b> panel in the upper left corner.</p><div><ul><li>Navigate through the video</li></ul></div><p>In the panel <b>Video commands</b>, the buttons allow user to control the video. <b>Play</b> continuously advances the video by 1 frame rate, <b>Fast forward</b> and <b>Rewind</b> continuously shift the video forward or backwards by 5 frames (default value).</p><p>The button <b>X/X</b> is a frame <i>go to</i> button. Clicking the button opens an edit field and user can input the index of a frame to display.</p><p>Mouse scroll button advances the video by 1 frame forward or backward, if the pointer hovers over the video canvas.</p><div><ul><li>Analyse the video</li></ul></div><p>Contrast analysis can be run by clicking <b>Analyse contrast</b>. The invoked function calculates standard deviation of intensity for each frame of the video (note this can take some time for long videos), this is so-called <b>SD2</b> contrast metric. The function also calculates <b>rSD2</b> contrast metric, which is a running standard deviation of the SD2 metric (i.e. it reports local changes in intensity distribution in time). The contrast metric can be displayed in the <b>Graph panel</b> in the upper right corner. The radio button <b>SD2/rSD2</b> in panel <b>Tracking</b> allows to switch between the two contrast metrics.</p><p>Both contrast metrics are scaled to have maximal value of 1. Therefore, all changes of the metric are only relative for each video.</p><p>The contrast metric provides information about image quality and suitability for testing. If the <b>SD2</b> decreases considerably (by &gt;5-10%), the pipette patter becomes difficult to match precisely and the bead difficult to recognize. In some cases, the <b>SD2</b> remains reasonably high, but is highly variable -- such behaviour is easy to spot as a peak in <b>rSD2</b>. Both metrics help user to determine, which sections of the captured recording should be excluded as the quality is insufficient for tracking.</p><div><ul><li>Overlay and export the results</li></ul></div><p>Once the tracking has been performed, the results can be laid over the original video recording. The bead is delineated by a red ring while the anchor point of the pipette tip is marked by a small blue ring. The <i>overlay</i> is switched on by checking the box <b>Display track info</b> in the <b>Video commands</b> panel.</p><p>The video with overlay can be exported into an external video file using the button <b>Generate film</b>, with framerate (in fps) given by the value in edit field <b>Framerate</b>. To reduce the output size and processing time, source video can be sampled by a factor given in the <b>Sampling</b> field.</p><p>The <b>Video information</b> panel contains a button <b>Reframerate</b> (which is active only for TIFF files). The information about framerate in TIFF files can be absent or damaged. The button allows the user to change the framerate of the video after it is imported.</p><h2>Tracking and calculation settings<a name="2"></a></h2><p>This section covers thresholds and other settings for tracking procedures, setting up the input variables, calculation of force and related parameters.</p><div><ul><li>Selecting a Bead and a Pipette pattern to track</li></ul></div><p>There are two ways to select the bead to track and to delineate the pipette tip pattern:</p><div><ol><li>An instantaneous selection using controls in the <b>Set interval</b> tab. Once video is open, <b>Select</b> button on the line <b>Selected bead</b> becomes enabled. Clicking the button turns the pointer into cross-hair (on the video canvas)--clicking inside the requested bead and confirming detects and delineates the bead (if video quality allows detection). Similarly, clicking the <b>Select</b> button on the line <b>Selected pattern</b> allows user to draw a delimiting rectangle around the pipette tip to select the pattern to be matched across the defined time interval.</li><li>A selection using lists in panels <b>Pipette pattern</b> and <b>Bead tracking</b>. (<i>These panels are initially hidden, but can be displayed using <b>Show tracking list panel</b> in the <b>Import, export, UI settings</b> panel.</i>) The pipette can be delineated clicking <b>Select</b> in <b>Pipette patterns</b> panel--the pointer turns into cross-hair and user can draw a box around the pipette tip and confirm by clicking the same button. The selection can be saved in the list of patterns clicking the <b>Add</b> button. Currently selected item of the list (i.e. the displayed item of the drop-down menu) can be removed clicking <b>Remove</b>. The bead can be added to a respective list using analogical procedure. Clicking <b>Select</b> in the <b>Bead tracking</b> panel and then clicking into requested bead and confirming, the program detects the bead (if possible). User can then add it to the bead list (the drop-down menu) using the <b>Add</b> button.</li></ol></div><p>The second explained method is useful for more complex trackings. For fragmented videos, one may want to reuse the same pipette pattern across several non-contiguous intervals, or recreate the interval list several times. Also note, that during the selection process, user is prompted to provide supplementary information about the bead (i.e. dark/bright) and pipette (i.e. select the anchor point).</p><div><ul><li>Setting parameters of tracking</li></ul></div><p>The tracking procedure can be tuned to strike balance between robustness and sensitivity. The panel is initially hidden and can be displayed clicking <i>Show advanced detection panel</i> toggle button on the <b>Import, export, UI settings</b> panel.</p><div><ol><li><b>Pipette detection settings</b> panel provides four parameters concerning the pipette. The <b>Correlation thresh</b> defines when the program reacts to decrease of correlation coefficient. If metric decreases below the threshold, procedure calls corrective functions, at (substantially) increased computational costs. These corrections can lead to marginal improvement, but on the other hand can help avert detection failure. Generally, if video contrast is stable during the video, this correlation metric threshold can be decreased. Note that there is an internal correlation threshold of <b>0.8</b>, below which the program invokes some of the corrective procedures, regardless of the user-provided value. The <b>Contrast thresh</b> is analogical, working with the SD2 contrast (and corrective measures are less aggressive). The <b>Buffer</b> represents the number of consecutive frames frames of failed detection, before the tracking is interrupted. <b>Erode/Dilate</b> edit fields allow to input parameters for a corrective procedure. This procedure attempts to detect also smaller (eroded) and larger (dilated) pattern in a sub-threshold frame, and returns the best match. For poor correlations (around 0.5), the improvement can be as high as 10%. The edit fields set up a range of search, from maximal erosion in pixels on the left by 1-pixel increments to the maximal dilatation in pixels on the right (1-pixel erosion means the border pixels of the pattern are removed, dilatation is inverse process; 2-pixel means the process is applied twice etc.). Note that setting both values to zero deactivates the procedure. Also note that both inputs should be positive numbers.</li><li><b>Bead detection settings</b> panel provides similar settings for the Bead. <b>Radius range</b> sets the range of possible bead radii (in pixels). The range can be estimated clicking the <b>Radius range</b> button---then clicking into a bead---the program detects the bead (using wide radius range), measures its range and sets optimal radius range accordingly. <b>Buffer</b> is the number of consecutive failed frames before the tracking is aborted. <b>Sensitivity</b> determines the threshold of circle detection, high sensitivity means more detected circles, which might be weak or obscured, raising chances of false positives. <b>Gradient</b> is a threshold for edge detection used to determine pixels on the circular object edge. Finally, if <b>Metric thresh</b> is crossed, the program relaxes settings (i.e. increases sensitivity and lowers gradient threshold) to detect also weak circles and avoid possible detection failure (i.e. no circle is detected).</li></ol></div><div><ul><li>Building an interval list</li></ul></div><p>The crucial feature of the tracking is setting up the list of discontinuous intervals to track (if necessary). This technique allows to analyse only frames of interest and avoid video intervals of poor focus or other problems. Intervals can be added to a list using the <b>Set interval</b> tab. On the line <b>interval</b>, initial and final frames of the interval must be supplied. The bead and pipette can be defined directly in the frame (see point <i>Selecting a Bead and a Pipette pattern to trak</i>) or loaded from the lists prepared in the panels <b>Pipette patterns</b> and <b>Bead tracking</b>. If taken from the list, clicking the button <b>List</b> sets the currently selected item of the respective list (i.e the displayed in the drop-down menu). <b>Select</b> button on <b>Pattern anchor</b> line allows user to specify pipette anchor---it is a point of the pipette, the coordinates of which are returned as the pipette coordinates, and used to calculate RBC deformation and force. The button <b>Show</b> displays the selected pipette pattern with the anchor point marked. Finally, the button <b>Add to list</b> adds the currently defined interval into the interval list of the current tool session. The parameters of the list of intervals can be reviewed on the tab <b>List of intervals</b>. Items can be removed from the list by selecting the appropriate check-box <b>Remove</b> (right-most column) and clicking the button <b>Erase</b>.</p><p>The last edit filed on the line <b>Interval</b> has a special function. It is the index of the frame, where the bead and the RBC touch under zero load (i.e. the RBC is unstrained) for the particular used pipette pattern. The distance of the anchor point on the pipette and the centre of the bead at this frame are later used, to calculate deformation of the RBC. Note that this frame does not need to belong to the currently set interval (also, the pipette pattern can originate in another interval), but it has to be an analysed frame (in any interval). If the provided index does not belong to any of set-up intervals, the tool initiates a procedure and helps user to set up single-frame interval.</p><p>Note that the intervals must be exclusive (though this may be changed in future).</p><div><ul><li>Tracking</li></ul></div><p>Running the tracking procedure itself is very simple. First, the tracking object (of <i>BFPClass</i>) has to be constructed. This is done simply by clicking <b>Update</b> button on the <b>Tracking</b> panel, after all settings and inputs are ready. The object contains all the settings and parameters set up in the GUI as well as the interval list. Note that whenever GUI settings are changed, the object must be reconstructed by clicking the <b>Update</b> button. Clicking the button <b>Track</b> invokes the tracking procedure of the <i>BFPClass</i>, which cycles through the interval list and tracks the Bead and the Pipette consecutively, according to the passed settings. It uses the contrast analysis (<b>Analyse contrast</b>) data, which are calculated at this point, if not yet available. After the tracking is finished, report is generated, showing the fidelity metrics of the bead and the pipette, marking intervals of lower detection quality (or intervals of rapid movements of the pipette), and providing explicit intervals of uncertain frames. This report can be displayed anytime by clicking <b>View report</b> on the <b>Tracking</b> panel.</p><div><ul><li>Calculation of the force</li></ul></div><p>Once the tracking is complete, the force can be calculated using the <b>Get Force</b> button on the <b>Tracking</b> panel. The function calculates distance between the centre of the bead and the anchor on the pipette for each frame and compares them to the distance at the frame of reference distance (the frame where the bead and the RBC touch, but the RBC is unstrained---zero load situation). The difference in distance corresponds to the compression/extension of the RBC. The RBC is (in the particular force range) in linear strain-stress regime, that means the force <img src="GUI_eq08597826192214703288.png" alt="$F$"> transduced by the RBC onto the manipulated object is proportional to RBC deformation <img src="GUI_eq16319215787732310329.png" alt="$\Delta x$"> through the RBC stiffness <img src="GUI_eq15636846968047188835.png" alt="$k$">, that is <img src="GUI_eq11892796486775896538.png" alt="$F=k\cdot\Delta x$">. The linear relation is valid up to the deformation <img src="GUI_eq15032494942525236997.png" alt="$\Delta x \approx 0.5 \mu m$">, then it begins to over-estimate the force, but usually by no more than 10% (within the range of viable forces). Detailed information about the stress-strain linear relation can be displayed clicking <b>?</b> button on the <b>Tracking</b> panel. The value of the RBC stiffness is displayed left of the <b>Get Force</b> button---if the text is not well readable due to text scaling issues, click the <b>k</b> button below.</p><div><ul><li>Probe calibration</li></ul></div><p>The force can be calculated without any calibration of the probe. The program is preset with generic probe data to provide user with an order of magnitude force estimate and the measured values of RBC deformation. To obtain precise measurements, user must perform geometry measurements for the probe. This can be done using <b>Experimental parameters</b> panel (initially hidden, can be displayed using <i>Show experimental data panel</i> on the <b>Export,Import,UI setting</b> panel). The panel contains interactive tools to measure parameters directly in the video. The button <b>Pixel to micron</b> allows user to calibrate the image by measuring a known length (i.e. a scale bar added by the software, the diameter of the standard micro bead etc.). Note that it is always more precise to provide this value directly based on the recording device information. The edit field <b>Pressure</b> represents the difference of pressures in the experimental medium and the pipette interiour (i.e. the aspiration pressure), which has to be provided by the user. <b>RBC radius</b> button allows user to click inside the RBC---after confirming the selection, the RBC is detected (if possible), and its radius is measured automatically. Similarly, <b>Pipette radius</b> allows user to draw a line across the inner diameter of the pipette at the internal RBC apex, the program then calculate the pipette radius based on the line; analogically for the radius of contact between the RBC and bead use the button <b>Contact radius</b>, and measure the radius in the frame of reference distance (see above).</p><h2>Graphing and fitting tools<a name="3"></a></h2><p>The tool supports graphing of 5 quantities. The quantity can be chosen from the drop-down menu on the <b>Tracking</b> panel and displayed in the <b>Graph</b> area in the upper right corner by clicking <b>Plot</b> button. The frame range can be restricted by typing the plotted range in the edit fields right of the <b>Plot</b> button. The check boxes below allow the user to select whether to plot data for bead, pipette or both (for some data, this choice is irrelevant). The options of the drop-down menu are:</p><div><ol><li><b>Contrast</b> plots the contrast measure of the of the video. Either <b>SD2</b> or <b>rSD2</b>, depending on the radio button selection below.</li><li><b>Force</b> plots the force (calibrated or uncalibrated) calculated based on the tracking results. A deformation values axis in displayed on the right, so even if the probe was not properly calibrated, the deformation information is accurate (if correct reference distance frame was selected).</li><li><b>Tracks (3D)</b> plots the position of the bead centre and/or pipette anchor point. The third axis represents the time.</li><li><b>Trajectories (2D)</b> plots the position of the bead centre and/or the pipette anchor point, without time information. All time points are plotted in one plane.</li><li><b>Metric</b> plots detection metric (i.e. correlation coefficient for the pipette and accumulator array value for the bead).</li></ol></div><p>Note that for the graphs with time abscissa (metric, force, contrast) are clickable. Clicking into the graphing area draws a vertical line and highlights the value of the quantity at the particular time frame, the values ordered pair is printed in the command window and the corresponding video frame is displayed in the <b>video player</b> section. This allows user to quickly review possible unexpected or strange behaviour in the graph.</p><p>Plotted graph can be fitted using tools in the <b>Basic fitting</b> panel. The button <b>Choose interval</b> (or later <b>Change interval</b>) is used to restrict the interval of fitting. When clicked, two dots are displayed. Positioning the dots in the field turns them into vertical lines delimiting the interval of fitting, which is confirmed by clicking the same button. The fitting procedures are invoked using the buttons above the interval selection button. <b>Fit line</b> performs a linear fit through the data. If several data lines are present (i.e. the graph is discontinuous), each section is fitted separately. The coefficient is displayed in the graph and printed in the command window. Similarly, the <b>Fit exponential</b> button has the same behaviour, only fits an exponential curve. The last fitting function, <b>Fit plateau</b> scans the data and attempts to find and highlight the plateaux intervals. The conditions for plateaux are defined below. <b>Sensitivity</b> represents the width of the edge detection kernel (the higher the sensitivity, the more data are considered plateau), <b>Thresh</b> is the standard deviation threshold to consider an interval a plateau, and <b>Length</b> is the minimal length (in frames) of plateau to report.</p><h2>Import/export<a name="4"></a></h2><p>The panel <b>Import, export, UI settings</b> allows the user to show/hide some of the panels (using the three labelled toggle buttons). The level of verbosity of the GUI can be changed using the checkbox <b>Verbose</b>, it switches warning dialogs into command window warnings. The edit field titles <b>UI Fontsize</b> allows user to set the global size of the font, to adapt to GUI to various screen sizes. Values above 1 are interpreted as pixels (note also that various systems interpret pixel font size differently), below 1 is normalized to the size of UI object.</p><p>The more important part of this panel is <b>import/export</b> section. Source and target have to be set from the drop-down menus. The arrows then show, what is ported where. Not all combinations are supported. Major feature is to export/import <b>session</b>, which represent the current session of the GUI, in form of MAT file. Other options are self-evident.</p><p class="footer"><br><a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Published with MATLAB&reg; R2015b</a><br></p></div><!--

%% BFPTool GUI documentation
% This file covers major aspects of the tool GUI.
%
%% Video playback and tools
% Section covers the tools related to video file.
%
% * Open a video file
%
% In the panel *Open a video*, user can either directly type full video
% file path or click the *Browse* button and navigate to the file. Once the
% file has been selected, it can be opened by clicking *Open*. The video
% will load and the first frame will be displayed in the video player.
% Data will be populated in the *Video information* panel in the upper left
% corner.
%
% * Navigate through the video
%
% In the panel *Video commands*, the buttons allow user to control the
% video. *Play* continuously advances the video by 1 frame rate, *Fast forward* and
% *Rewind* continuously shift the video forward or backwards by 5 frames (default
% value).
%
% The button *X/X* is a frame _go to_ button. Clicking the button opens an
% edit field and user can input the index of a frame to display.
%
% Mouse scroll button advances the video by 1 frame forward or backward, if the
% pointer hovers over the video canvas.
%
% * Analyse the video
%
% Contrast analysis can be run by clicking *Analyse contrast*. The invoked
% function calculates standard deviation of intensity for each frame of the
% video (note this can take some time for long videos), this is so-called 
% *SD2* contrast metric. The function also calculates *rSD2* contrast
% metric, which is a running standard deviation of the SD2 metric (i.e. it
% reports local changes in intensity distribution in time). The contrast
% metric can be displayed in the *Graph panel* in the upper right corner.
% The radio button *SD2/rSD2* in panel *Tracking* allows to switch between
% the two contrast metrics.
%
% Both contrast metrics are scaled to have maximal value of 1. Therefore, all
% changes of the metric are only relative for each video.
%
% The contrast metric provides information about image quality and
% suitability for testing. If the *SD2* decreases considerably (by >5-10%),
% the pipette patter becomes difficult to match precisely and the bead
% difficult to recognize. In some cases, the *SD2* remains reasonably high,
% but is highly variable REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH such behaviour is easy to spot as a peak in
% *rSD2*. Both metrics help user to determine, which sections of the
% captured recording should be excluded as the quality is insufficient for
% tracking.
%
% * Overlay and export the results
%
% Once the tracking has been performed, the results can be laid over the
% original video recording. The bead is delineated by a red ring while the
% anchor point of the pipette tip is marked by a small blue ring. The 
% _overlay_ is switched on by checking the box *Display track info* in the
% *Video commands* panel.
%
% The video with overlay can be exported into an external video file using the button
% *Generate film*, with framerate (in fps) given by the value in edit field
% *Framerate*. To reduce the output size and processing time, source video
% can be sampled by a factor given in the *Sampling* field.
%
% The *Video information* panel contains a button *Reframerate* (which is
% active only for TIFF files). The information about framerate in TIFF
% files can be absent or damaged. The button allows the user to change the
% framerate of the video after it is imported.
%
%% Tracking and calculation settings
% This section covers thresholds and other settings for tracking procedures,
% setting up the input variables, calculation of force and related
% parameters.
%
% * Selecting a Bead and a Pipette pattern to track
%
% There are two ways to select the bead to track and to delineate the
% pipette tip pattern:
%
% # An instantaneous selection using controls
% in the *Set interval* tab. Once video is open, *Select* button on the
% line *Selected bead* becomes enabled. Clicking the button turns the
% pointer into cross-hair (on the video canvas)REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHclicking inside the
% requested bead and confirming detects and delineates the bead (if
% video quality allows detection). Similarly, clicking the *Select* button
% on the line *Selected pattern* allows user to draw a delimiting rectangle
% around the pipette tip to select the pattern to be matched across the
% defined time interval.
% # A selection using lists in panels *Pipette pattern* and *Bead
% tracking*. (_These panels are initially hidden, but can be displayed using
% *Show tracking list panel* in the *Import, export, UI settings* panel._)
% The pipette can be delineated clicking *Select* in *Pipette patterns*
% panelREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHthe pointer turns into cross-hair and user can draw a box around
% the pipette tip and confirm by clicking the same button. The selection can
% be saved in the list of patterns clicking the *Add* button. Currently selected
% item of the list (i.e. the displayed item of the drop-down menu)
% can be removed clicking *Remove*. The bead can be added
% to a respective list using analogical procedure. Clicking *Select* in the
% *Bead tracking* panel and then clicking into requested bead and confirming, the program
% detects the bead (if possible). User can then add it to the bead list (the drop-down menu)
% using the *Add* button.
%
% The second explained method is useful for more complex trackings. For fragmented
% videos, one may want to reuse the same pipette pattern across several
% non-contiguous intervals, or recreate the interval list several times. Also
% note, that during the selection process, user is prompted to provide
% supplementary information about the bead (i.e. dark/bright) and pipette
% (i.e. select the anchor point).
%
% * Setting parameters of tracking
%
% The tracking procedure can be tuned to strike balance between robustness
% and sensitivity. The panel is initially hidden and can be displayed
% clicking _Show advanced detection panel_ toggle button on the
% *Import, export, UI settings* panel.
%
% # *Pipette detection settings* panel provides four parameters concerning
% the pipette. The *Correlation thresh* defines when the program reacts to
% decrease of correlation coefficient. If metric decreases below the
% threshold, procedure calls corrective functions, at (substantially)
% increased computational costs. These corrections can lead to marginal
% improvement, but on the other hand can help avert detection failure.
% Generally, if video contrast is stable during the video, this correlation 
% metric threshold can be decreased. Note that there is an internal 
% correlation threshold of *0.8*, below which the program invokes some of 
% the corrective procedures, regardless of the user-provided value.
% The *Contrast thresh* is analogical, working with the
% SD2 contrast (and corrective measures are less aggressive). The *Buffer*
% represents the number of consecutive frames frames of failed detection, 
% before the tracking is interrupted. *Erode/Dilate* edit fields allow to
% input parameters for a corrective procedure. This procedure attempts to
% detect also smaller (eroded) and larger (dilated) pattern in a sub-threshold frame, and returns the best
% match. For poor correlations (around 0.5), the improvement can be as high as 10%. The
% edit fields set up a range of search, from maximal erosion in pixels on
% the left by 1-pixel increments to the maximal dilatation in pixels on the
% right (1-pixel erosion means the border pixels of the pattern
% are removed, dilatation is inverse process; 2-pixel means the process is
% applied twice etc.). Note that setting both values to zero deactivates
% the procedure. Also note that both inputs should be positive numbers.
% # *Bead detection settings* panel provides similar settings for the Bead.
% *Radius range* sets the range of possible bead radii (in pixels). The
% range can be estimated clicking the *Radius range* buttonREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-then clicking
% into a beadREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-the program detects the bead (using wide radius range),
% measures its range and sets optimal radius range accordingly. *Buffer* is
% the number of consecutive failed frames before the tracking is aborted.
% *Sensitivity* determines the threshold of circle detection, high
% sensitivity means more detected circles, which might be weak or obscured,
% raising chances of false positives. *Gradient* is a threshold for edge
% detection used to determine pixels on the circular object edge. Finally,
% if *Metric thresh* is crossed, the program relaxes settings (i.e. increases
% sensitivity and lowers gradient threshold) to detect also weak circles
% and avoid possible detection failure (i.e. no circle is detected).
%
% * Building an interval list
%
% The crucial feature of the tracking is setting up the list of
% discontinuous intervals to track (if necessary). This technique allows to
% analyse only frames of interest and avoid video intervals of poor focus
% or other problems. Intervals can be added to a list using the *Set
% interval* tab. On the line *interval*, initial and final frames of the
% interval must be supplied. The bead and pipette can be defined directly
% in the frame (see point _Selecting a Bead and a Pipette pattern to
% trak_) or loaded from the lists prepared in the panels *Pipette patterns* and *Bead
% tracking*. If taken from the list, clicking the button *List* sets the
% currently selected item of the respective list (i.e the displayed in the 
% drop-down menu). *Select* button on
% *Pattern anchor* line allows user to specify pipette anchorREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-it is a
% point of the pipette, the coordinates of which are returned as the
% pipette coordinates, and used to calculate RBC deformation and force. The
% button *Show* displays the selected pipette pattern with the anchor point
% marked. Finally, the button *Add to list* adds the currently defined
% interval into the interval list of the current tool session. The parameters of the list of
% intervals can be reviewed on the tab *List of intervals*. Items can be
% removed from the list by selecting the appropriate check-box *Remove* (right-most column) and
% clicking the button *Erase*.
%
% The last edit filed on the line *Interval* has a special function. It is
% the index of the frame, where the bead and the RBC touch under zero load
% (i.e. the RBC is unstrained) for the particular used pipette pattern.
% The distance of the anchor point on the pipette and the centre of the
% bead at this frame are later used, to calculate deformation of the RBC.
% Note that this frame does not need to belong to the currently set
% interval (also, the pipette pattern can originate in another interval),
% but it has to be an analysed frame (in any interval). If the provided
% index does not belong to any of set-up intervals, the tool initiates a
% procedure and helps user to set up single-frame interval.
%
% Note that the intervals must be exclusive (though this may be changed in future).
%
% * Tracking
%
% Running the tracking procedure itself is very simple. First, the tracking
% object (of _BFPClass_) has to be constructed. This is done simply by
% clicking *Update* button on the *Tracking* panel, after all settings and 
% inputs are ready. The object contains all
% the settings and parameters set up in the GUI as well as the interval
% list. Note that whenever GUI settings are changed, the object must be
% reconstructed by clicking the *Update* button. Clicking the button
% *Track* invokes the tracking procedure of the _BFPClass_, which cycles
% through the interval list and tracks the Bead and the Pipette
% consecutively, according to the passed settings. It uses the contrast
% analysis (*Analyse contrast*) data, which are calculated at this point,
% if not yet available. After the tracking is finished, report is generated,
% showing the fidelity metrics of the bead and the pipette, marking
% intervals of lower detection quality (or intervals of rapid movements of 
% the pipette), and providing explicit intervals of
% uncertain frames. This report can be displayed anytime by clicking *View
% report* on the *Tracking* panel.
%
% * Calculation of the force
%
% Once the tracking is complete, the force can be calculated using the *Get
% Force* button on the *Tracking* panel. The function calculates distance
% between the centre of the bead and the anchor on the pipette for each frame
% and compares them to the distance at the frame of reference distance (the
% frame where the bead and the RBC touch, but the RBC is unstrainedREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-zero
% load situation). The difference in distance corresponds to the
% compression/extension of the RBC. The RBC is (in the particular force
% range) in linear strain-stress regime, that means the force $F$
% transduced by the RBC onto the manipulated object is proportional to
% RBC deformation $\Delta x$ through the RBC stiffness $k$, that is
% $F=k\cdot\Delta x$. The linear relation is valid up to the deformation
% $\Delta x \approx 0.5 \mu m$, then it begins to over-estimate the force,
% but usually by no more than 10% (within the range of viable forces). Detailed information about the
% stress-strain linear relation can be displayed clicking *?* button on the
% *Tracking* panel. The value of the RBC stiffness is displayed left of the
% *Get Force* buttonREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-if the text is not well readable due to text scaling
% issues, click the *k* button below.
%
% * Probe calibration
%
% The force can be calculated without any calibration of the probe. The
% program is preset with generic probe data to provide user with an order
% of magnitude force estimate and the measured values of RBC deformation.
% To obtain precise measurements, user must
% perform geometry measurements for the probe. This can be done using
% *Experimental parameters* panel (initially hidden, can be displayed using
% _Show experimental data panel_ on the *Export,Import,UI setting* panel). 
% The panel contains interactive tools to
% measure parameters directly in the video. The button *Pixel to micron*
% allows user to calibrate the image by measuring a known length (i.e. a
% scale bar added by the software, the diameter of the standard micro bead
% etc.). Note that it is always more precise to provide this value directly
% based on the recording device information. The edit field *Pressure*
% represents the difference of pressures in the experimental medium and the
% pipette interiour (i.e. the aspiration pressure), which has to be
% provided by the user. *RBC radius* button allows user to click inside the
% RBCREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-after confirming the selection, the RBC is detected (if possible),
% and its radius is measured automatically. Similarly, *Pipette radius*
% allows user to draw a line across the inner diameter of the pipette at
% the internal RBC apex, the program then calculate the pipette radius
% based on the line; analogically for the radius of contact between the RBC
% and bead use the button *Contact radius*, and measure the radius in the
% frame of reference distance (see above).
%
%% Graphing and fitting tools
% The tool supports graphing of 5 quantities. The quantity can be chosen from
% the drop-down menu on the *Tracking* panel and displayed in the *Graph*
% area in the upper right corner by clicking *Plot* button. The frame range
% can be restricted by typing the plotted range in the edit fields right of
% the *Plot* button. The check boxes below allow the user to select whether
% to plot data for bead, pipette or both (for some data, this choice is
% irrelevant). The options of the drop-down menu are:
%
% # *Contrast* plots the contrast measure of the of the video. Either *SD2*
% or *rSD2*, depending on the radio button selection below.
% # *Force* plots the force (calibrated or uncalibrated) calculated based
% on the tracking results. A deformation values axis in displayed on the
% right, so even if the probe was not properly calibrated, the deformation
% information is accurate (if correct reference distance frame was
% selected).
% # *Tracks (3D)* plots the position of the bead centre and/or
% pipette anchor point. The third axis represents the time.
% # *Trajectories (2D)* plots the position of the bead centre and/or the pipette
% anchor point, without time information. All time points are plotted in
% one plane.
% # *Metric* plots detection metric (i.e. correlation coefficient for
% the pipette and accumulator array value for the bead).
%
% Note that for the graphs with time abscissa (metric, force, contrast)
% are clickable. Clicking into the graphing area draws a vertical line and
% highlights the value of the quantity at the particular time frame, the
% values ordered pair is printed in the command window and the
% corresponding video frame is displayed in the *video player* section.
% This allows user to quickly review possible unexpected or strange
% behaviour in the graph.
% 
% Plotted graph can be fitted using tools in the *Basic fitting* panel. The
% button *Choose interval* (or later *Change interval*) is used to
% restrict the interval of fitting. When clicked, two dots are displayed.
% Positioning the dots in the field turns them into vertical lines
% delimiting the interval of fitting, which is confirmed by clicking the
% same button. The fitting procedures are invoked using the buttons above the 
% interval selection button.
% *Fit line* performs a linear fit through the data. If several data lines
% are present (i.e. the graph is discontinuous), each section is fitted
% separately. The coefficient is displayed in the graph and printed in the
% command window. Similarly, the *Fit exponential* button has the same
% behaviour, only fits an exponential curve. The last fitting function,
% *Fit plateau* scans the data and attempts to find and highlight the
% plateaux intervals. The conditions for plateaux are defined below.
% *Sensitivity* represents the width of the edge detection kernel (the
% higher the sensitivity, the more data are considered plateau), *Thresh*
% is the standard deviation threshold to consider an interval a plateau, and
% *Length* is the minimal length (in frames) of plateau to report.
%
%% Import/export
% The panel *Import, export, UI settings* allows the user to show/hide some
% of the panels (using the three labelled toggle buttons). The level 
% of verbosity of the GUI can be changed using the checkbox *Verbose*, it
% switches warning dialogs into command window warnings. The edit field titles
% *UI Fontsize* allows user to set the global size of the font, to adapt
% to GUI to various screen sizes. Values above 1 are interpreted as pixels
% (note also that various systems interpret pixel font size differently),
% below 1 is normalized to the size of UI object.
%
% The more important part of this panel is *import/export* section.
% Source and target have to be set from the drop-down menus. The arrows
% then show, what is ported where. Not all combinations are supported.
% Major feature is to export/import *session*, which represent the current
% session of the GUI, in form of MAT file. Other options are self-evident.
